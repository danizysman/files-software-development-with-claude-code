# Safe Refactoring Skill

When asked to refactor code, follow these safety steps:

## Before Making Changes
1. Identify existing tests for the code being modified
2. Run tests to confirm they pass before changes
3. Understand the current behavior completely

## During Refactoring
1. Make small, incremental changes
2. Preserve all existing functionality
3. Extract helpers or reorganize without changing behavior
4. Add clear docstrings to new functions

## After Changes
1. Run tests again to verify behavior is preserved
2. Review the diff to confirm only intended changes
3. Suggest any additional tests if coverage gaps exist

## Example: Extracting a Helper Function

When extracting logic into a helper:
```python
# Before: Logic embedded in main function
def process_data(items):
    # Preparation logic here
    prepared = [transform(i) for i in items if valid(i)]
    # Main processing
    return calculate(prepared)

# After: Helper extracted
def prepare_items(items):
    """Prepare items for processing by filtering and transforming."""
    return [transform(i) for i in items if valid(i)]

def process_data(items):
    prepared = prepare_items(items)
    return calculate(prepared)
```

Always verify tests pass after extraction.
