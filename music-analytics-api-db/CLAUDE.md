# Music Analytics API - Database Only

This directory contains only the Chinook database (`chinook.db`). 

**Important:** This is a fresh project. Create all code files from scratch in THIS directory. Do not reference or copy code from other directories.

## Database
- `chinook.db` - SQLite database with music data (artists, albums, tracks)

## Your Task
When asked to create Flask endpoints, create a new `app.py` file in this directory that:
1. Connects to the local `chinook.db`
2. Implements the requested endpoints
3. Returns JSON responses
